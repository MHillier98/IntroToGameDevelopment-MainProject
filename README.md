# IntroToGameDevelopment-MainProject
The Unity game project for Assessments 3 + 4, for Intro To Game Development.

This project was built in [Unity 2018.3.8](https://unity.com/)


# Task
The aim of these two assignments was to recreate a classic game in the Unity game engine.

I chose to recreate 'Ms. Pac-Man', which came with the following constraints:
*  With characters moving with continuous motion (not grid-based) and each color ghost having the following behaviours when the power-up pill has not been consumed.
   * Green – Move randomly at each junction in the level
   * Pink – Move clock-wise around the level
   * Blue – Run away from Ms. Pac-man
   * Red – Chase Ms. Pac-man
