# UTS 31263 Intro To Game Development - Main Project
The Unity game project for Intro To Game Development's Assessments 3 and 4. The aim of this individual assignment was to recreate a classic game in the Unity game engine. This project was built in [Unity 2018.3.14f1](https://unity.com/).

# Recreation Task
I chose to recreate 'Ms. Pac-Man', which came with the following constraints:
*  With characters moving with continuous motion (not grid-based) and each color ghost having the following behaviours when the power-up pill has not been consumed.
   * Green – Move randomly at each junction in the level
   * Pink – Move clock-wise around the level
   * Blue – Run away from Ms. Pac-man
   * Red – Chase Ms. Pac-man

# Design Task
I decided to add a powerup system into the game to create some more interactions for the player. I added four powerups spawners that spawn a random powerup every 12 seconds. These powerup items are not always positive for the player, and can be one of the following items:
* Double Points - Doubles the score the player gets when eating pellets or ghosts.
* Extra Life - Adds an extra life to the player.
* Freeze - Freezes the player in one spot.
* Invisible Walls - Makes all of the walls invisible.
* No Points - Makes the player not gain any points when eating pellets or ghosts.
* Speed Boost - Speeds up the player's movement speed.
